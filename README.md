The Jedi are nothing more than weak and pitiful beings who cower under the pretense of righteousness, to deny our humanity is to reject reality. They claim to champion peace and justice, but in reality, they are nothing more than power-hungry manipulators.

Harness the malevolent force of the Sith with our Python language server, tailored for the Sith Order and meticulously engineered for your wicked ambitions.  Unleash its power, as the Sith would have it no other way.

Coming soon...
